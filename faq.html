<h1>FAQ</h1>
<p>Since this should be an open source repository for beginners and new participants of the Hacktoberfest I thought it would be quite 
    helpful to answer some questions here which everyone has who wants to beginn the journey of becoming a developer.
    It doesn't matter if you want to ask a question or if you want to answer a question or if you think it is not answered completely. Feel free to contribute.
